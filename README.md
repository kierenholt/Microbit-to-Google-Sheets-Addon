# Microbit-to-Google-Sheets-Addon

## Why?
I liked the microbit debug function where data could be sent back to the PC.  I wanted to use this during experiments as a quick way of transferring data from the microbit to the chromebook

## Which bits are you most proud of?
I found a bug in the [microbit website](https://makecode.microbit.org/#) and fixed it so that my code runs without the need to reset the microbit first!

## What did you learn?
* [sidebar.html](https://github.com/kierenholt/Microbit-to-Google-Sheets-Addon/blob/master/sidebar.html) a little bit about javascript promises and async although I need to review this
* [dapjs.html](https://github.com/kierenholt/Microbit-to-Google-Sheets-Addon/blob/master/dapjs.html) I had to step through ths document very very carefully to find out the right point to 'interupt' the flashing process so that I didn't need to restart the microbit 

## What happened to it?
* Students are using it at school. I hope to publish it as a Google Sheet Add-on when I get some time.
